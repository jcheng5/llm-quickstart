### AI Hackathon Cohort 21 {style="text-align: center; font-size: 72pt; color: #414142;"}

::: {style="text-align: center; color: #414142;"}
July 29, 2025
:::

```{r include=FALSE}
slack_channel <- "#hackathon-21"
```

# Welcome!

We are:

- **Andrew Holz** - Director of Engineering, Open Source
- **Joe Cheng** - CTO
- **Winston Chang** - Principal Software Engineer

And we have lots of other Posit folks who are ready to help!

## Your Turn

- Your name, team, and role
- How have you used LLMs/AI tools up until now?
- What is your skepticism/enthusiasm score (1 to 5)?

## The Plan {.smaller}

::: {.incremental}
- **Now:** Quick Start course on LLMs. You will leave having used a Chat API.
- **Next 48 hours:** Hack on stuff! Minimum four hours of effort. "Rules" on the next slide.
  - We'll be continuously monitoring `r slack_channel`
- **Thursday:** Show & tell, share lessons learned, reflections.
- **Post-hackathon:**
  - Keep hacking! (optional)
  - Think about how AI might apply to your team
  - Be a resource for others around you
<!-- - **Post-hackathon:** Create/deploy an LLM-enabled Shiny app for your company. We can help! -->
:::

## Hack On Stuff

::: {.incremental}
- **Does NOT have to be relevant to your day job, or Posit, or data science.**\
  This exercise is about learning and engagement, not ROI.
- **Does NOT have to be a finished product/demo/app/API.**\
  Showing some things you did in a notebook is fine as long as YOU found it interesting.
- **Does NOT have to use Posit products.**\
  You may use any framework, any language, any service that you have access to.
:::

## Hack On Stuff

::: {.incremental}
- **Does NOT have to be an original idea.**\
  You can build on existing projects, improve on existing demos, etc.
- **Does NOT even have to be coding.**\
  Do a deep dive into an AI service or piece of software. Create something in [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/), or assemble a useful [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google/), and see what its limits are.
- **Does NOT have to be a success.**\
  Negative results (“I thought LLMs could do this but turns out they can’t”) are useful results as well. But please be prepared to talk about what you tried.
:::

## Not a contest

- This is not a competition. There are no prizes, no judging.
- Everyone is coming from different backgrounds and has different levels of experience with AI, with coding, etc.
- The goal is to learn, to have fun, and to engage with the technology---and share what you learned with others (and not just within this cohort).

## Let It Rip

* All that said... also feel free to throw down, and make something super cool!

::: {.incremental}

* Four hours is the minimum, not the maximum---if you're having fun, keep going!

<!-- ## A Note on Data Security

- Please refrain from sending your proprietary code or data to any LLM, unless you are sure your company's policies allow it.
  - AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud all host frontier models—your IT might be OK with these.
- If you absolutely must use proprietary info, consider using a local model (but expect considerably worse results). -->

## A Caveat From IT

No _proprietary_ code or data is allowed to be sent to any LLM service, with the below exceptions.

- Google NotebookLM is allowed.
- AWS Bedrock is allowed, and it has Anthropic models. ([Instructions](https://positpbc.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SE/pages/1376550915/Using+Claude+via+Bedrock+at+Posit))
- Running any local model is allowed, we can help you with this as well.
- Sending open source code to any service is allowed.
